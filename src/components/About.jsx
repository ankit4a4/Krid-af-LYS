          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-[#2D384B]/80">
            Studio KAL - Krid AF Lys - was founded in 2022 by Tanvi Porwal as a luxury interior design studio offering bespoke, end-to-end design services. Tanvi brings over a decade of high-end residential, commercial, and hospitality experience throughout Delhi and has taken her expertise to Dehradun to open a boutique practice focused on creativity and detail.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-[#2D384B]/80">
            At Studio KAL, we believe space should tell a story. Our work fuses artistry with functionality to create interior spaces that are not only beautiful but personal. From full-scale design projects to styling consultations, we design spaces that cater to the unique personality and dreams of each of our clients.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 text-[#2D384B]/80">
            Whether it's a dream home, a boutique hotel, or a special shoot setting, we always design with a tailored approach, with a thoughtful process, while maintaining uncompromising quality. With "KAL" meaning tomorrow in Hindi, we simply believe in creating timeless spaces while thinking of the futureâ€”spaces that will feel as beautiful today as they will tomorrow.
